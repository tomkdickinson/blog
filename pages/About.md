### What is this site?

My name is **Tom**, and this is my personal blog on all things **software engineering, data science, and machine 
learning**. By day, I'm currently a **Senior Software Engineer** at a headless e-commerce company building 
**Go** microservices for the cloud, while by evening I delve into personal projects around deep learning. 
I also have a **PhD in Computer Science** 

### My Background

Way back in 2010 I graduated from Newcastle University with a **2.1 BSc Hons in Computer Science**. For the next
three years, I pottered about London as a software developer working first in the
gambling industry, then as a technical consultant for a large software company, and finally as a software
developer for a small consultancy. 

However, I eventually tired of the London scene and wanted to challenge myself, so decided to do a **PhD at
the Open University**. What started out as something looking at narrative on social media, quickly pivoted 
into a **machine learning classification problem to identify personal life events on social media**. This 
predominantly focused on a form of feature extraction from semantic and syntactic graphs using frequent 
subgraph mining. If this short summary makes zero sense to you, feel free to check out my 
[thesis](http://oro.open.ac.uk/68265/).

After my three year stipend was used up, I opted to go back into industry as a software developer while
writing up my thesis in what little spare time I had. This resulted in a move back up to Newcastle, where
I have worked for companies in the pharmacutical, housing, and most recently e-commerce domain. For the past 
two years, I have been focusing on building cloud native microservice architectures, with a heavy emphasis
on **testing, reliability, and code maintainability**.

### My Interests

My current up to date interests involve **scalability of software**, not just from a **performance aspect**,
but also a **development aspect**. There's no point in writing software that is extremely performant, which
only a handful of developers can contribute to.

Since I've had a little break from my PhD, I've recently gotten back into **Machine Learning**, specifically
the applications of **deep learning**. Right now I'm looking into areas of **Computer Vision**, and am on a 
personal quest to upscale all my old DVDs to 4k.
