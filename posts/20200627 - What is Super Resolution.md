Recently, I have been trying to get back into Machine Learning as it's been several years since my PhD, and the field
has dramatically moved on. 
Most of my research used more traditional models such as SVMs, RandomForests, and NaiveBayes.  

Specifically, I've been very interested in getting more into Deep Learning. In the past I've played around a little
with CNNs, but it was no more than seeing how they worked. 

So in order to provide myself a refresher in this area, I've given myself a non-trivial task to implement. 

I have many old TV shows on DVDs, and these days I have a nice big 4k OLED TV and I don't particularly want to buy 
Blu-ray or UHD versions of something I've already paid for. 
In fact, many of the shows I enjoy rewatching don't even have that option. 

Now, this problem could be solved by buying a decent upscaling Bluray player, or paying for something like

use this as an opportunity to get my feet wet with some deep learning, and build some models to upscale my older video
collection for me? 

To put more succinctly, the task I am giving myself is to take
